# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements the logistic regression algorithm from scratch using Python and NumPy to ensure a deep understanding of the math and concepts behind the model.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is used for this project, but it is simplified to a binary classification problem (e.g., Setosa vs Versicolor).

## Methodology
1. **Logistic Regression from Scratch**:
   - No libraries like scikit-learn are used.
   - Implemented gradient descent for optimization.
   - Sigmoid function applied to model probabilities.

2. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Decision boundary visualization.

## Results
- 

## Future Work
- Extend to multi-class classification using one-vs-rest approach.
